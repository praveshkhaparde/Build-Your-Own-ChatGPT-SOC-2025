## Week 8: Build Your Chatbot with Botpress & Ollama

### Botpress

**Botpress** is a simple tool to build chatbots without much coding. You can design how the bot talks, test it, and make it live — all in one place.

## Milestone 6  
### Legal Adviser Bot

Build a chatbot that provides legal guidance using either **Botpress** or **LLaMA via Ollama**.

- Generate a 3000–5000 word PDF of text from ChatGPT about Indian laws and regulations  
- Try to add preprocessing steps like removing headers/footers, chunking by section, and converting to plain text  
- Show the chatbot's output for sample legal questions directly in your README

I will suggest trying both of them and trying to compare which performs better.
