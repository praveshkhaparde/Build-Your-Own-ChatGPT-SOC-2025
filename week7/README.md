## Week 7: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid approach that combines **retrieval-based methods** with **generative language models**. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, a RAG system fetches relevant documents from an external knowledge base and uses that context to generate more accurate and grounded responses.

### Applications of RAG

-  **Open-domain QA**: Fetch facts from a database and generate fluent answers  
-  **Document summarization** with real-time data  
-  **Chatbots** that can reason with external sources   
-  **Medical & Legal Assistants** that refer to up-to-date documents
