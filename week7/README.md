## 📅 Week 7: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

### 🤖 What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a hybrid approach that combines **retrieval-based methods** with **generative language models**. Instead of relying solely on pre-trained knowledge, a RAG system fetches relevant documents from an external knowledge base and uses that context to generate more accurate and grounded responses.

### 🧠 Applications of RAG

- 📚 **Open-domain QA**: Fetch facts from a database and generate fluent answers  
- 🧾 **Document summarization** with real-time data  
- 💬 **Chatbots** that can reason with external sources  
- 🏥 **Medical & Legal Assistants** that refer to up-to-date documents
