In this and upcoming week,we will focus on Transformers which are DL models that process sequential data efficiently, powering NLP tasks like translation and text generation,We will learn about this with the help of following materials-  
Here is the excellent playlist-

Then we will give milestone 3 which will be same as milestone but have to use transformer for embeddings, you can choose any model of your choice.  Those who have actually done milestone 2 will just need to add few lines  

Note : you not supposed to fine-tuning
  
**Milestone 3**
**Sentiment Analysis Model using LSTM (classify movie reviews as positive/negative)**
