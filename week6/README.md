###  What To Do

Use ChatGPT to help you with the following:

- Understand how to use the **Gemini Free 2.5 / 2.0 Flash API**
  - How to use it via **Postman**
  - How to use it via **Python**
- Create a **basic local HTML website** that makes Gemini API calls to enable a conversational chatbot.
- Build a **Node.js-based chatbot website** (use ChatGPT to generate the boilerplate code).
