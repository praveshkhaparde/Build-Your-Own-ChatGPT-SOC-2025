## NLP Basics for This Project

We will begin by learning the fundamentals of **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, focusing on two essential Python libraries:

- **NLTK** (Natural Language Toolkit)
- **Gensim**

These libraries will be particularly useful for tasks like tokenization, lemmatization, topic modeling, and text preprocessing â€” all of which are crucial for building our final chatbot.
